## Research Interests
I study the evolution of ferns at UC Berkeley in the [Rothfels Lab](https://rothfelslab.berkeley.edu/) in Integrative Biology. I am interested in the role polyploidy has had in the diversification of plants. In particular, I am fascinated by a minute floating heterosporous fern [*Azolla*](https://btiscience.org/explore-bti/news/post/fern-tastic-genomes-in-nature-plants/) and in the evolution of the [floating ferns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salviniales) more generally.
Some dissertation projects currently underway:

1. Total evidence dating under the fossilized-brtih-death process in Salviniales, implemented in [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io/).
2. Exploring hidden states in various State-dependent Speciation and Extinction (SSE) models.
3. 16S Microbiome analyses of *Azolla* leaf pockets across the genus.

When I am not working on my dissertation, I sometimes work on projects with these long-time research collaborators:
- [Jeremy Coate](https://sites.google.com/site/coatejeremy/), Visiting Assistant Professor of Biology, Reed College, on polyploidy related matters.
- [Sarah Schaack](https://sites.google.com/site/schaackwork/), Assistant Professor of Biology, Reed College, on transposable element fun. 

I am also broadly interested in plants and their uses as food, symbols, metaphors, and medicine.
I have most recently presented my work on plant metaphors at the 2018 UC Berkeley Comparative Literature Conference [*Future (Im)Perfect*](https://futureimperfectconf.wordpress.com/).

Not necessarily plant related, but I have been taking Ancient Greek for a couple years now and am also learning Russian. I am fascinated by translation as much as I am afraid of it. So perhaps this terror will lead to new creative and scholastic endeavors, but as of now it is definitely at least a "research interest."

I am a part of the Botany Suite, a small working group of plant scientists at Cornell University and UC Berkeley. Members include [Jesus Martinez-Gomez](https://jesusthebotanist.github.io/), [Carrie Tribble](https://carrietribble.weebly.com/), [Betsy Castro](http://betsabecastro.com/), and [Isaac Lichter‐Marck](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Isaac_Lichter-Marck). We are also a [band](https://botanysuite.bandcamp.com/releases).

I am also a part of a cadre of Reed College graduates who are doing great work in graduate school and often collaborate with them. Some of them include [Jimmy LaBelle ’15 (Political Science, Columbia)](https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/james-william-labelle), [Joshua Gancher ’16 (Cryptography, Cornell)](https://www.initc3.org/people.html), [Jacob Robertson ’15 (Biology, UCSD)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jacob_Robertson3), [Rennie Meyers ’15 (Marine Affairs, URI)](https://builtfromcrookedtimber.com/about/hello/). Expect some joint publications in the future. My Reed College colleagues are also brilliant editors at [The Hypocrite Reader (Caroline Brickman ’11 (UC Berkeley))](http://hypocritereader.com/) and [Khabar Keslan (Orla O'Sullivan ’16)](https://www.khabarkeslan.com/). Some are even engineers, like [Kata Martin ’15](https://katamartin.com/), who help me keep this website fun and cool.

Collaboration is the creative force that inspires me to keep working and publishing, so if you are interested in similar stuff I'd love to work with you, whether it be academic, artistic, or about building working-class power. Just let me know! You can email me or even better, send a letter.
