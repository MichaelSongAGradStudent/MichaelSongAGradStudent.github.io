## New Job
I have just been hired as an Assistant Professor of Biology at Skyline College! See you in the Fall!

## Research Interests
<img src="/images/AzollaPrelimData.jpg" alt="CCPG Azolla Project" style="width:700px">

I studied the ecology and evolution of plants at UC Berkeley in the [Rothfels Lab](https://rothfelslab.berkeley.edu/) in Integrative Biology. For much of my work, I have been interested in the role of polyploidy in plant evolution and in the dynamics of mobile elements. For my dissertation, I used synthetic neo-autotetraploid lines of Arabidopsis to elucidate the effects of polyploidy on the community of commensal microorganisms (the microbiome) that are associated with plants, and then determined whether these effects impact the plantsâ€™ responses to pathogens and predators. Find it now out in [Current Biology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960982222007746)!

One of my current projects (see above) involves researching the genomics of the Azolla symbiosis with the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCPG) in conjunction with the Rothfels Lab. Our preliminary data shows an incredible amount of co-diversification in the group!

I sometimes work on projects with these long-time research collaborators:
- [Jeremy Coate](https://sites.google.com/site/coatejeremy/), Visiting Assistant Professor of Biology, Reed College, on polyploidy related matters.
- [Sarah Schaack](https://sites.google.com/site/schaackwork/), Assistant Professor of Biology, Reed College, on transposable element fun. 
- [Jesus Martinez-Gomez](https://jesusthebotanist.github.io/) and [Carrie Tribble](https://carrietribble.weebly.com/) on assessing different methods for estimating branch specific shifts in diversification rates. 

I am also broadly interested in plants and their uses as food, symbols, metaphors, and medicine.
I presented some thoughts on plant metaphors at the 2018 UC Berkeley Comparative Literature Conference [*Future (Im)Perfect*](https://futureimperfectconf.wordpress.com/).
I am also an amateur classicist and slavicist! At [AATSEEL 2020](https://www.aatseel.org/program), I gave a paper at a round table about the 19th century Russian metaphysical poets and contemporary American female country music. How fun!
