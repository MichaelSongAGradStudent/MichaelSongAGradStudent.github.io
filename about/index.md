## Research Interests
I study the evolution of ferns at UC Berkeley in the [Rothfels Lab](https://rothfelslab.berkeley.edu/) in Integrative Biology. I am interested in the role polyploidy has had in the diversification of plants.
Some projects currently underway:

1. Total evidence dating under the fossilized-brtih-death process in Salviniales, implemented in [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io/).
2. Exploring hidden states in various State-dependent Speciation and Extinction (SSE) models.
3. 16S Microbiome analyses of *Azolla* leaf pockets across the genus.

I am also broadly interested in plants and their uses as food, symbols, metaphors, and medicine.
I have most recently presented my work on plant metaphors at the 2018 UC Berkeley Comparative Literature Conference [*Future (Im)Perfect*](https://futureimperfectconf.wordpress.com/).

Not necessarily plant related, but I have been taking Ancient Greek for a couple years now and am also learning Russian. I am fascinated by translation as much as I am afraid of it. So perhaps this terror will lead to new creative and scholastic endeavors, but as of now it is definitely at least a "research interest."
