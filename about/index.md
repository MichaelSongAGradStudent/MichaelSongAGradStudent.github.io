## Research Interests

I study the evolution of ferns at UC Berkeley in the [Rothfels Lab](https://rothfelslab.berkeley.edu/) in Integrative Biology. For much of my work, I have been interested in the role of polyploidy in plant evolution and in the dynamics of mobile elements. Currently, however, I am fascinated by a minute floating heterosporous fern [*Azolla*](https://btiscience.org/explore-bti/news/post/fern-tastic-genomes-in-nature-plants/) and its associated microbiota, which fixes nitrogen among other things. My dissertation seeks to understand on what level does natural selection act for such organinisms that are considered holobionts.

When I am not working on my dissertation, I sometimes work on projects with these long-time research collaborators:
- [Jeremy Coate](https://sites.google.com/site/coatejeremy/), Visiting Assistant Professor of Biology, Reed College, on polyploidy related matters.
- [Sarah Schaack](https://sites.google.com/site/schaackwork/), Assistant Professor of Biology, Reed College, on transposable element fun. 

I am also broadly interested in plants and their uses as food, symbols, metaphors, and medicine.
I have most recently presented my work on plant metaphors at the 2018 UC Berkeley Comparative Literature Conference [*Future (Im)Perfect*](https://futureimperfectconf.wordpress.com/).

I am a part of the Botany Suite, a small working group of plant scientists at Cornell University and UC Berkeley. Members include [Jesus Martinez-Gomez](https://jesusthebotanist.github.io/), [Carrie Tribble](https://carrietribble.weebly.com/), [Betsy Castro](http://betsabecastro.com/), and [Isaac Lichter‐Marck](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Isaac_Lichter-Marck). We are also a [band](https://botanysuite.bandcamp.com/releases).

I am also a part of a cadre of Reed College graduates who are doing great work in graduate school and often collaborate with them. Some of them include [Jimmy LaBelle ’15 (Political Science, Columbia)](https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/james-william-labelle), [Joshua Gancher ’16 (Cryptography, Cornell)](https://www.initc3.org/people.html), [Jacob Robertson ’15 (Biology, UCSD)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jacob_Robertson3), [Rennie Meyers ’15 (Marine Affairs, URI)](https://builtfromcrookedtimber.com/about/hello/). Expect some joint publications in the future. My Reed College colleagues are also brilliant editors at [The Hypocrite Reader (Caroline Brickman ’11 (UC Berkeley))](http://hypocritereader.com/) and [Khabar Keslan (Orla O'Sullivan ’16)](https://www.khabarkeslan.com/). Some are even engineers, like [Kata Martin ’15](https://katamartin.com/), who help me keep this website fun and cool. I am also a member of the [Twin Chicken (Abby Curry)](http://jamescurryiv.com/) fan club.

Collaboration is the creative force that inspires me to keep working and publishing, so if you are interested in similar stuff I'd love to work with you, whether it be academic, artistic, or about building working-class power. Just let me know! You can email me or even better, send a letter.
