I study the evolution of ferns at UC Berkeley in the Rothfels Lab in Integrative Biology. I am interested in the role polyploidy has had in the diversification of plants.
Some projects currently underway:
<ul>
		<li>Are Ks plots really that convincing when it comes to the oodles of recently inferred paleopolyploidy events?</li>
		<li>How is a freshly synthesized polyploid genome expressing itself? We're looking at you, our favorite little mustard! </li>
		<li>Diversity and microbiome of Azolla in California.</li>
	</ul>

<p>Oral Paper - "Plants and Posthumanism"</p>
<p>A result of climate change is that organismal biologists are forced to engage with and imagine the future in a new theoretical framework — a framework characterized by our own demise as a species. Two common narratives in organismal biology are (1) evolution as a concern with death and extinction (2) and ecology which is atemporal and concerned with the production of and interactions within space. By exploring these two narratives, evolution and ecology, I will ask how our interactions with plants under this framework disrupts the accepted, anthropocentric reading of global warming. How does a focus on the plant kingdom complicate accepted theories about the so-called sixth mass extinction? My position is the possibility of a post human aspect to ecological narratives should give us hope and should be explored further in our discussions as scholars, workers and laborers facing a changing climate.</p>

<p>Oral Paper - Quantifying transcriptome size variation and dosage responses immediately following ploidy change in Arabidopsis thaliana.</p>
<font size="2">
<p>It is now widely considered that all vascular plants have experienced ancient whole genome duplications (WGDs) and subsequent genome reductions.
There are biases in the patterns of gene retention and loss based on the types of duplications experienced and the types of genes involved.
The Dosage Balance Hypothesis (DBH) has been proposed to account for the observation that classes of genes which retain duplicates originating from WGDs will often have proportionately fewer genes that derive from small-scale duplications.
Although dosage responses have been measured for allopolyploids in young natural populations, very little is known about the effects of WGD on transcriptome size (the number of transcripts per cell) and therefore on individual gene dosage responses.
We sequenced the transcriptomes of two synthetic autopolyploid accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana and their diploid progenitors to estimate transcriptome size and gene dosage responses immediately following ploidy change.
Our preliminary results are consistent with the DBH and illustrate that there are immediate transcriptional responses to polyploidy—induced gene dosage increase that are consistent across genotypes at the level of gene ontology and metabolic networks, but vary among the individual genes expressed.</p>

<p>Poster - Difficulties in the Inference of Ancient Whole-Genome Duplications</p>
<font size="2">
<p>Polyploids—those individuals that have experienced whole genome duplications (WGDs)—were classically regarded as evolutionary dead ends.
In a remarkable shift of scientific opinion, the seemingly opposing view—that ancient WGDs are commonplace in the ancestry of many extant lineages—has recently come to predominate, such that most evolutionary biologists accept that many genomes (including those of nearly all plants) have been shaped by of multiple rounds of WGD.
This rapid shift in viewpoint was brought about the increased availability of genome-scale data and by a novel set of inference methods, which have changed the way we think about plant genome evolution and its relationship to patterns of angiosperm diversification.
Here, we caution that our overconfidence in the widely employed inference methods.
One inference method forms a disproportionate basis of evidence supporting WGDs and their ages.
It relies on distributions of nucleotide distances of synonymous mutations (Ks) among paralogous genes.
The models that shape our expectations of Ks distributions, and the associated statistical tests, may not have the advertised ability to reliably discern ancient polyploidization events from a number of confounding processes.
As a consequence, it is possible that we have vastly overestimated the prevalence of ancient WGDs.</p>
