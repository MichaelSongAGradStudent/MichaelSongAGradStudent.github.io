I study the evolution of ferns at UC Berkeley and I am interested in the role polyploidy has had in the diversification of plants (and not just flowering plants!)
Some projects currently underway:
<ul>
		<li>Are Ks plots really that convincing when it comes to the oodles of recently inferred paleopolyploidy events?</li>
		<li>Assessing the evolutionary consequences of transposition in the germline vs. in somatic tissue, why do TEs move like they move?</li>
		<li>How is a freshly synthesized polyploid genome expressing itself? We're looking at you, our favorite little mustard! </li>
	</ul>
