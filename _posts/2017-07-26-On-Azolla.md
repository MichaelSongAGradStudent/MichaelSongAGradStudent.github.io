Hi everyone, 

First off, thank you all so much for helping me collect Azolla! The following should be all you need to become expert botanists and pteridologists. I’ll be sending you personally more information as well as a postcard with a cheat sheet.

### Cheat Sheet
If you lose the cheat sheet this is what it says:
“Seven Pillars of Azolla Collecting
1. Carry a ziplock bag with you while hiking
2. Put Azolla in bag and record and describe the location
3. Once at home separate ten individuals from the bag, wash them with water and a lil bit of soap
4. Put them in a coin envelope with a name, date, and ID number and put the envelop into a new zip lock bag full of silica gel
5. Separate the rest out, rinse them, and array as many as you can on an index card
6. On another index card write out the genus name (“Azolla”), the collector (“Your Name Here”), the date, a description of the location (with GPS data preferable), a short description of the habitat and plant, and the ID number you put on the coin envelope
7. Make an azolla sandwich with the two index cards and put into a light paperback to send to Mick who will send you back a new fun book to read. Surprise!”

### Finding Azolla
Anyways, it’s all moot if we can’t find Azolla. I’m really bad at it haha. I’ll be send you all lists with locations that it was found in the past, but really the can be found anywhere along the edges of lakes at any time of year, you just need to get lucky!

If you want to do some hunting yourselves, I recommend using the website and app [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org) and making an account! it’s really helpful. From the site you can look for spots that Azolla has been spotted. Also you can use the website [gbif](gbif.org) which is hard to use but very exhaustive. For Californians, the [Consortium of California Herbaria](http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/consortium/) is a good resource to find spots.

Ok, so you’re hiking with your zip-lock bag…

You come across a lake.

or maybe...

You come across this.

Now you inspect it closer.

Here's a guide to duckweek left and Azolla right! Sometimes they are found together!

Bingo! Bag it and tag it! Then follow the instructions on the cheatsheet and mail the ferns to my address! 

### Fun Facts about Azolla

You may be asking yourself, now an Azolla identifying expert, why this fern? Also, how is this a fern? Mick is studying this? Here’s an FAQ about Azolla for those wishing to take this hike to a fun dinner table story.

![What even is a species](~/images/AZOLLA.jpg "AZOLLA")

Azolla is a genus in the family Salviniaceae in the order Salviniales, which is known as the “floating fern family.” It is a family of floating ferns that are all heterosporous which means that they make different types of spores, which are megaspores and microspores. Heterospory has evolved independently a few times, most notably in the seed plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms) and in the Azolla family we have another instance of the convergent evolution of this trait. 

Azolla is also cool because it has leaf pockets that contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which are vertically inherited and whose genomes are highly reduced. It is thought that these bacteria are undergoing the process of becoming an organelle. See Symbiogenesis on wikipedia! It has been used in rice cultivation as a green manure. It is also thought to have contributed to global cooling in the Eocene, when the world changed from a greenhouse to an icehouse climate, by having a ginormous bloom over the freshwater layer on top of the Arctic ocean at the time and being a big carbon sink. Very neat! This is a blog post where I’m rambling, but I’ll try and put up the links to the academic papers at my leisure! 

Anyways there’s thought to be so-and-so number of species, but because the fern is so small and the characters so similar, to describe species morphologically is a mess. That’s why we need all this DNA. For DNA to be of good enough quality for me to extract and use by means of PCR, it needs to be dried quickly and thus I will provide you with a large bag of silica to dry the samples preserved in the coin envelopes. Just put the envelop in the silica in the bag! The silica will change color as it becomes “wet” but these beads can be recharged by putting them in the microwave on a tray or in the oven (see http://qqjky.qjhbf.servertrust.com/v/vspfiles/info/Silica%20Gel.pdf). If you don’t have the bag, I’ve also had success drying in a large amount of coarse NaCl salt!
