*"Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we'll keep the red flag flying here"*

On November 11 2018, several dozen rank-and-file members presented evidence at an hearing to appeal for the annulment of the contract ratification that occured this summer.
[The appeal states](https://mussmanappeal.wordpress.com/), "We the undersigned, as members in good standing of UAW Local 2865 (“Local Union”), write to appeal the contract ratification vote that took place in August 2018. The contract ratification vote violated union by-laws and did not follow both legally binding union procedures as well as customary voting procedures. Accordingly, through this appeal, we seek the invalidation of the contract ratification vote because it violates Local Union Bylaws and circumvented democratic procedures and assurances that are followed during elections that ensure all members a reasonable and equal opportunity to participate to vote. We appeal the procedural legitimacy of the ratification vote which happened through a fundamentally undemocratic process and in violation of union bylaws on the following grounds" [see post below for the whole appeal].

It is very heartening to see that even in the midst of a reactionary take-over of a once radical union, the rank-and-file will not be silenced.

Before the meeting students gathered to sing union songs such as "Hey, Hey, Daloy Politsey (Hey Hey Down with the Police)," before appealing the undemocratic and manipulative practices taken by the union leadership to settle a 4 year concessionary contract in summer 2018, foreclosing the possibility of not only a raise but striking for demands like demilitarization.
