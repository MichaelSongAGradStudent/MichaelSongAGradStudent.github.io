A short essay I wrote for Slavic 46 during Spring 2019.

## The Proem of 150 000 000

                  150 000 000 мастера этой поэмы имя.

                  Пуля — ритм.

                             Рифма — огонь из здания в здание.
                  
                  150 000 000 говорит губами моими.

—Mayakovsky 1919-1920

In creating in verse the "democratic language of the streets,"1 there are two obvious problems. The language of the streets is spoken and spontaneous, while poems are written down and recited. How does one convert meaning expressed in time with meaning expressed in space through recitation? Likewise, how can the language of the streets, in its multitude, be expressed democratically by a single poet in verse? The proem of Mayakovsky’s 150 000 000 (1919-1920) gives us a sense of how the futurists envisioned their poetic project and demonstrates many of the formal aspects of their resolution of these contradictions. This resolution comes through the repurposing of the traditional form of the epic, a tradition that is spoken, illiterate, and culturally (as opposed to individually) composed. 

Let us first enumerate some of the formal aspects of the poem. The poem is an epic with cosmological scope, narrative form, and (inter)national myth centering on two heros (the Russian Ivan and the American Woodrow Wilson.2 Like the proem of the Aeneid, its relationship to the Iliad and the Odyssey is made evident in structure of the verse. The first word of the epic is the most important and sets the theme of the poem: Arma virumque (arms and the man), μῆνιν (cosmic wrath), ἄνδρα (man). Here, the theme is “150 000 000,” which not only is a number (an abstract symbol of something almost uncountable, cosmic in scope) but also a man (Ivan) that strangely and alarmingly is combined with the “craftsman of this poem.” The author and subject of the poem are the same 150 000 000 whose words come from the 150 000 000 of Russia and become the author by means of mass printing “by the rotary footsteps on the cobblestone paper of squares” and mass recitation as “150 000 000 now speak through my lips.” 150 000 000 is a multitude and also a man, and in this way we can see how Mayakovsky attempts to solve the second contradiction between poet and society, but it may not feel satisfactory. This resolution becomes more legitimate when we see how Mayakovsky further positions this multitude within a traditional form.

In the Odyssey we also have a multitude in a man, introduced in the first line as ἄνδρα πολύτροπον.  He is obviously Odysseus, but is not named in the proem, and his own ambiguities are a central theme of the poem. 150 000 000 is equally ambiguous, who as the poet of the poem about himself, speaks with the rhythm of “the bullet” and the rhyme of “a fire spreading from building to building.” But other than that we need to wait and find out who Ivan is and the multitude of beasts, humans, and machines that constitute him. It is notable that we do not know that 150 000 000 is a “man” in the proem as this ambiguity predicts the cosmic merging of humans, beasts, and machines. In this way Ivan and communism supercede all of the history of societies where this distinction is paramount (note the parallels to a similar transgression in the Iliad where the οἰωνοῖσί (birds of prey) have a δαιτα (ritual feast)3) and in this is the nature of revolution, the creation of a society entirely new. And it is truly not natural: the old cosmic rules do not apply and new ones need to be made.

When something in our lives happens that is unusual we will often say that we are “at a loss for words,” so what would the spontaneous language of the streets sound like during the most unusual of all events, revolution? Here we resolve our first contradiction as the formal differences between speech and writing, which are manifest most clearly in their routines uses, are displaced and incited to perform new functions and become more similar. The poet gives language to the revolutionary worker’s chants and slogans just as the worker’s chants and slogans give language to the poets works. We see how this works in the poem shortly after the proem, when we come across the leaflet where the spoken and the written become the same. The jussive force of the printed diagonal

                  “Everyone

                            Everyone

                                      Everyone”

is both imitated in but also perhaps mimetic of the speech that comes later from the cars and beasts

                  “I’ll come to him,
			                        I’ll tell him:
				                               “Wilson,” I’ll say
							                                        “Woodrow,””
                                                      
and also the poet himself in the proem:

                  “The bullet is its rhythm.
                  		          Its rhyme, a fire spreading from building to building.”
                                
In a similar way, the poet and the characters of the epic all speak in the same dactylic hexameter. Mayakovsky by using the genre of the epic brings us back to a prewritten form of poetry, one that is not authored, in order to perform a new revolutionary use. Though like Virgil, he is the author, the tradition manifest in its form at least attempts to transcend the author and speak to and as a society. 

The final formal aspect of this poem I wish to show betrays that the future in Mayakovsky’s Futurism is the not eternal nature of revolution.4 The proem with its seven lines clearly imitates structurally the proem of the Iliad. And yet, the subject matter of the poem is the man, the 150 000 000, a new man merged with beast and machine, but a man nonetheless. So while the words of the poem themselves are Iliadic and the end of the poem we are left with the Odyssean man, who we have summoned and who will go forth after the revolution. Here, “The Odyssey of hungry years is for you!”

1. http://v-mayakovsky.com/biography.html
2. As metaphors for capitalism and communism, it is interesting in this regard as it predicts the sentiments of “социализм в одной стране” which of course would come a couple years later in 1924.
3. A transgression of societal norms so shocking that early editors of the Iliad have changed the line to “οἰωνοῖσί τε πᾶσι,” which makes less sense and is less interesting, but does reveal the deeply unnatural nature of this description of war. From Leslie Kurk, personal communication.
4. Remembering our footnote about the Stalinist reading of Ivan as “социализм в одной стране,” this is an anti-Trotskyist position.
