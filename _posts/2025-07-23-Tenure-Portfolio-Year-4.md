# Fall 2025 Tenure Portfolio Year 4 Skyline College
Hello! Welcome Tenure Committee! Thank you for being a part of my committee and giving me the opportunity to share my portfolio for you all. On this page you will find the links to all of the required material for my tenure portfolio as well as a rationale for why these are good and representative examples of my work.

This is my fourth year teaching at Skyline and this portfolio is a reflection of the work that I have done so far during my time here.

I bring ten years of teaching experience in higher education to my role as Assistant Professor and am committed to bringing student-centered and equitable practices to my courses.

You can learn more about my teaching philosophy below and I hope you enjoy the subsequent linked materials.

## Highlight of fourth year additions to the portfolio
I published a peer-reviewed article in _The American Biology Teacher_ about my **innovative teaching approaches to introductory biology at Skyline**. It is currently in press.

This year alone, I have published **four additional peer-reviewed articles**, in three of which I am first author, in internationally recognized journals like _The Journal of Heredity_, _The American Journal of Botany_, and _Madroño_. See CV. The research done at Skyline has led to the development of **new lab exericises** and **three honors projects**. Additionally, the collaborations developed by this research has led to **Skyline students obtaining lab experience** at institutions like The California Academy of Sciences and SF State. 

I have also added an **example of instructor feedback** to the portfolio as recommended in the last portfolio review.

[Here](https://michaelsongagradstudent.github.io/blog/2022/10/12/Teaching-Philosophy) is a statement of my teaching philosophy, updated 2025 to address my perspective on AI.

## Examples of Work (click on links)
My course **syllabus** for [BIOL 215]([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ygOtrPWUWbjW4ADPwr--O9_1qZBOG4yl/view?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10yTaEkavkgBJ79hh4e5lvdJF9pSYorvL/view?usp=share_link)).

An example [**quiz**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ZmRxWAb_cKlTx-JnSZnlXm9Va3vEMhlCBK12pAomiY/edit) and an example [**exam**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lC5AeCmI0t33ETkdXTxg9vuZ2owGJzqewRwQGsHMZKM/edit?usp=sharing) for BIOL 215, a course for majors.

Here is an [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ywlnEgnYV2Vggj7n-1m5OEO_ZWs6wu-vrDRBSv6F2iU/edit) of a **key information handout** for the plant unit of 215.

Here is an [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QoWNUp9wRhnoJojbyO5xOWYRZJmgGQ4j_pJcl1heT4A/edit?usp=share_link) of a **key project** using iNaturalist to teach taxonomy.

Here is an [example](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QLZlE3EsxK2jbkM2j-vxt9KMZcyQVTzO/view?usp=share_link) of a **worksheet** on evolution.
Examples of some [**discussion prompts**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13_huUnvvpwsLPTrLrJftVhgqu3tMY7coWDtT8DXxWws/edit).

Here is an [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10UEZ4T8RxxcloNn33e4X_crX-FDMIaiPlDxDUL5IB7U/edit#heading=h.si8b46euu0k7) of a **representative assignment** teaching students how to use primary sources.

Here is an [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ISmoC403ucK_3CUu9NNwZGIDH1cnNnXr543tawZyJUk/edit?usp=sharing) of **instructor feedback** to one of my assignments. 

Finally, I re-wrote the [lab manual for Biol 215](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17NYHa7MvVQS5i2gXrjhKe61Pgp_4NW0e/view?usp=sharing) as a ZTC OER!

## Rationale for inclusion in the portfolio

The work above is representative of my teaching philosophy.

My examples demonstrate how I have moved away from assessing rote memorization towards encouraging a synthesis of the material by having short answer questions in my quizzes and midterms.

I stress discussion, synthesis, and clear articulation of ideas via group work and writing instead of test taking skills and memorization. This practice promotes equity in the classroom since it does not reward more priviledged students.

The précis assignment and iNaturalist project assignment demonstrate my commitment to encouraging student creativity and curiousity in a structured and rigorous way that is at the same time student-led.

The example of instructor feedback demonstrates how I give individualized feedback to students, use a rubic for my assignments, and allow for students to improve and learn from their mistakes.

I also am committed to the Skyline College Education Master Plan (especially number 3: "Ensure that all students have the support and resources needed to achieve their educational goals") and have thus made all of my courses ZTC with OERs, including the lab manual that I have written.  

## Professional Development activities:

I attended the 3-day long SEPAL Evidence-Based Teaching Institute at SF State.

I attended the 3-day [Summer of Nanopore](https://dnalc.cshl.edu/email/2024-summer-nanopore-sequencing/) Professional Development workshop hosted at Skyline College by the Cold Spring Harbor DNA Learning Center. My goal is to bring this cutting edge technology into the classroom by 2026.  

I am one of the faculty leads of a Skyline **President's Innovation Fund** award of $7500: Earth Day Every Day with Qimmah, Marisa, Mays, and Rachel.

I was awarded a California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office **Zero-Textbook-Cost award** of $5000 to write a new lab manual for BIOL 215.

## Professional Service:

I am currently serving as chair of the the **STEM Division Scholarship Committee** and on the **Technology Committee**. 

I have served on **Academic Senate** as a STEM representative and as **co-advisor** of the Skyline environmental club (SAGE).

I have also served on the **2024 Skyline Presidential Search Committee**.

I have served on **three adjunct evaluation committees**. 

I mentored two students as a part of [**IMMERSE in STEM**](https://www.skylinecollege.edu/immerse/#:~:text=IMMERSE%20in%20STEM%20scholars%20will,address%20financial%20and%20academic%20barriers.).

I have supervised **12 honors students** since arriving at Skyline College and written **25 letters of recommendation** landing students in REUs and summer internships at institutions as prestigous as UCSF. 

**Two honors projects students** (Kea and Meagan) published a peer-reviewed journal manuscript with me in the _American Fern Journal_ (in press), the premier academic journal on pteridology. 

I represented Skyline College as an **invited guest speaker** at San Francisco State University and at the North American Rock Garden Association Summer Conference at the UC Botanical Garden.
