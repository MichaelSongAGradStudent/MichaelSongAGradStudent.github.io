# Introduction
This summer, I was lucky enough to be in Florence with loved ones and made a day trip out to Pisa. We of course made the necessary tourist pictures with the Leaning Tower, but wanted something more. Luckily, we happened across the world's first ever academic botanical garden the Orto Botanico di Pisa, founded in 1544 by Cosimo I de’ Medici. Although, this distinction is disputed since the garden moved locations twice, once in 1563 and most recently in 1591; the Orto botanico di Padova hasn't moved since its founding in 1545. Nonetheless, it was here that Luca Ghini, a 16th century botanist who taught at the affiliated Università di Pisa, created the first herbarium. Although, his system bound herbarium samples into books that could be sited. It wasn't until Linnaeus that the plants were freed to individual sheets.

Anyone interested in the history of botany should visit, it is a truly lovely place with a wonderful arboretum, aquatic plant collection, and a greenhouse devoted to succulents. What struck me however, as the most wonderful of this garden was the fact that it consisted of several smaller gardens, each with their own history, often founded in different centuries. There is a large section called the scuola botanica where plants are arranged by family, another older garden where plants are arranged by their medicinal uses, yet another garden devoted to cedars(?). Of course, these are all very common ways of organizing gardens, but seeing all these different paradigms in such small gardens reminded me again of all the different ways we categorize plants and the ways that we have prioritized different organizational patterns over time.
