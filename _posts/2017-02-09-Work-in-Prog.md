# Introduction
This winter, I was lucky enough to be in Florence with loved ones and made a day trip out to Pisa. We of course made the necessary tourist pictures with the Leaning Tower, but wanted something more. Luckily, we happened across the world's first ever academic botanical garden the Orto Botanico di Pisa, founded in 1544 by Cosimo I de’ Medici. Cosimo I was also the Medici that built the Villa di Castello and the Bobili Gardens (and the Uffizi). The distinction of establishing the oldest academic garden, however, is disputed since the garden moved locations twice, once in 1563 and most recently in 1591; the Orto botanico di Padova hasn't moved since its founding in 1545. Nonetheless, it was here that Luca Ghini, a 16th century botanist who taught at the affiliated Università di Pisa, created the first herbarium. Although, his system *bound* herbarium samples into books that could be cited. It wasn't until Linnaeus that the plants were freed to individual sheets.

Anyone interested in the history of botany should visit, it is a truly lovely place with a wonderful arboretum, aquatic plant collection, and a greenhouse devoted to succulents. What struck me however, as the most wonderful of this garden was the fact that it consists of several smaller gardens, each with their own history, often founded in different centuries. There is a large section called the scuola botanica where plants are arranged by family, another older garden where plants are arranged by their medicinal uses, yet another garden devoted to cedars(?). Of course, these are all very common ways of organizing gardens, but seeing all these different paradigms in such small gardens reminded me again of all the different ways we categorize plants and the ways that we have prioritized different organizational patterns over time. In this garden, Andrea Cesalpino, Ghini's successor, worked on his book *De Plantis Libris XVI* (1583). This book described over 1,500 plants not as an herbal or alphabetically, but by a hybrid of a modified Aristotelian woody-non-woody classification, and his original classification of plants by their flowers and seeds.

And of course, this got me thinking about Linnaeus and his garden (Linnéträdgården) and how language plays such a fundamental role in our endeavors as botanists in ways pretty unique to our field. I argue that botanists think about their language far more and more thoughtfully than any other practitioners of science and are thus well-equipped to help scientists generally deal with existential problems when it comes to communication and the future of our professions. But more on that at the end of the talk, first I wish to speak a little about the interactions between ideology, aesthetics, and language to explore how we exist within a multiplicity of "ways of seeing," and how that is a good thing, and how *that* should be the method of attack when approaching the task of science communication. 

# Background
First some background! What am I even talking about when I say language? And how does that interact with ideology and aesthetics and isn't that something we don't have to worry about as scientists?

So who even thinks about language as a scientist? Well, I know Brent Mishler does and his papers on the species problem and the taxon problem (1) are fantastic examples of really fruitful debate that inform and drive forward research in the field of systematics. And this year, of course, is the XIX International Botanical Congress in Shenzhen, China. It is here that an international body votes to adopt changes to the [*International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants*](http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title). If you haven't read the code, I would recommend it. You know, I used to suffer from insomnia before becoming a botanist. It is a laborious process; first, proposed changes to the code must be published in *Taxon*, the journal of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) and then voting happens over the course of a week during the Congress every six years. Anyways, it is by this highly codified system that we name plants and it is within this highly structural approach that we conduct science. Now, I want to convince you that this framework has implications for all of us, not just the pedants.

To do so requires us to remember our history, in particular the history of how plants were named. We will see that changes in nomenclature reflect different ways of seeing, influenced by the aesthetics and ideology of the namer. There are far too many people and ideas to mention in this brief talk but here (INSERT TIMELINE) we can look at a timeline of the major botanical figures, their contributions to the language, next to important historical events. We can, however, look at some major figures.

## Linnaeus
I first wish to talk about Linnaeus. Just to get on the same page, I want to give a brief outline of his life, a figure we are all too familiar with, but perhaps don't remember the finer points. He was born in the countryside Småland in 1707 to a lineage of peasant and priests and was prepared to join the priesthood. Yet, just like the pre-meds I teach, a blossoming love of plants along with poor study habits prevented him from doing something undesirable. His early life was characterized by poverty and the generosity of patrons who allowed him to have access to the best libraries in Sweden and time to botanize. In 1732, he was awarded an grant from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala to make an expedition to Lapland, where he identified over 100 new plants, drafted his first major work Flora Lapponica, and developed his ideas about nomenclature. Well, what do you do when you become the world expert on plants in the 18th century? Nothing, because you don't practice medicine and don't have a doctorate. So he went to the University of Harderwijk to get a dissertation printed in a week, curing malaria along the way (avoid clay-rich soil), and thus became a physician. In 1735, he publishes *Systema Naturae* which of course you know is the introduction of the binomial system we all use today. I will talk about this in more depth soon. What is important to note, is here in Linnaeus' career, he starts cultivating a network of very rich friends, such as George Clifford III, a director of the Dutch India Trading Company, and Sir Hans Sloane of England whose  gardener was Philip Miller. Miller was one of the preeminent botanists of his time and his reference series *The Gardeners Dictionary* was one of the most widely read books on gardening in England and adopted the binomial system in 1768. He returns to Sweden, starts a family, becomes Rector of Uppsala University, gets knighted, yadda yadda. In 1753, he publishes *Species Plantarum* which is the start-date for modern botanical nomenclature, his new methodology outlined previously in the 1951 work *Philosophia Botanica*. He made botany a hot field of study and attracted dozens of apostles from Europe that explored the world and made the binomial system ubiquitous. So that's all I want to say about his life. Since I titled this talk "Learning from Linnaeus," the two things we can learn from his life are:

1. Made a bunch of rich and powerful friends in your life and have them all adopt your ideas.
2. If you want your ideas to spread, have apostles. Worked for Linnaeus *and* Jesus.

For me, what is striking about Linnaeus' system is his distinction between "real" taxa which for him are genera and species and the artificial distinctions of his "sexual system." In many ways, this was a real innovation and the ubiquity of Linnaean taxonomy, I would argue, is that we generally still believe species are real. But why even have artificial distinctions? Well, it is because this distinction, though imperfect and somewhat artificial, for Linnaeus reflected the "secret working-plan of the creator" and was an improvement on all the other systems of classification because so (ref 1).
In fact, the modern day narratives of uncovering the wonders of the natural world, I argue reflect his ideology. Why are we so afraid of losing biodiversity? Why do we care that ~80% of the world's estimated species go unnamed (2)? Is it not because we find ourselves as Linnaeus did, stewards of God's earth, a second Adam, the one's to name and to know all of creation? And why do we feel this way, we're mostly non-religious these days? It is because Linnaeus changed the language by which we work! Changed insofar that his particular Adam-ist aestetics are reflected in his sense of order, yet on the other-hand his changes are a modification of Ray's and Tournefort's and other previous systems and thus take with them vestiges of the ideologies that governed their organizing priciples. For example the *scala naturae* and principle of plenitude, to which of course Linnaeus also subscribed.  All these narratives are nested in the language we use to speak about biology.

Well, we still use binomial nomenclature, but we have moved far from Linnaeus in our understanding of the relationship of living organisms, and many current scientists advocate a rank-free system. This is all true. In terms of Darwin and the revolution of evolution, the Linnaean rank-system was able to eventually incorporate evolutionary thinking into its nomenclature and now monophylly or shared-descent is the governing principle that organizes the system.

Just by using a name, let us just use the most loaded one *Homo sapiens*, you conjure so many ideas. You can use this name for man to separate man from beast and the animal, vegetal, and mineral world because we are unique and have our own name. You may just as easily conjure up a phylogeny in your mind with man nested within apes as you may imagine a tree with man at the apex as in the *scala naturae*. And of course the name comes with a *type species.* For the case of *Homo sapiens,* you have the remains of Linnaeus himself as the type. You are also speaking in Latin. Think about that. In two words, you contain, transfer, and transmute past narratives into your present one. This is important to consider when we think about our field as communicating new ideas and knowledge more generally.

# Problematic
How do we communicated new ideas? Peer-reviewed journals, okay. But the trend these days is to emphasize what is called science communication, that is communicating science to the public. How do we do that? Twitter. Here, we must be very careful with how we frame our communications, because there is a tendency to frame science within the narrative of "logic based reasoning." In short, there is ignorance and through robust data and strong logic we can rid the world of bad ideas. But, when ideas become reduced to "this is right" (or "this is more right than before") kinds of arguments, which scientists often fall prey to, it becomes easier for sorting algorithms (our collective brain, e.g. [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8Dd5aVXLCc) to prevent connecting people with new thought-provoking ideas. Our communication is mediated by data-driven analytics that mean to segregate us into echo-chambers. 

## Twitter and Science Communication
Let's evaluate how good these media by which we try and communicate science are to perhaps think about ways to optimize our outreach and impact.

# Treatment
Our narratives are diverse and wildly appealing, use them.

## Climate Change and the Language of Evolution
Evolution has a million narratives and it seems like climate change has a few?
