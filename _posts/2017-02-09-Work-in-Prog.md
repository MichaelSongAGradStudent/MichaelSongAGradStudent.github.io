# Introduction
This summer, I was lucky enough to be in Florence with loved ones and made a day trip out to Pisa. We of course made the necessary tourist pictures with the Leaning Tower, but wanted something more. Luckily, we happened across the world's first ever academic botanical garden the Orto Botanico di Pisa, founded in 1544 by Cosimo I de’ Medici. Cosimo I was also the Medici that built the Villa di Castello and the Bobili Gardens (and the Uffizi). The distinction of establishing the oldest academic garden, however, is disputed since the garden moved locations twice, once in 1563 and most recently in 1591; the Orto botanico di Padova hasn't moved since its founding in 1545. Nonetheless, it was here that Luca Ghini, a 16th century botanist who taught at the affiliated Università di Pisa, created the first herbarium. Although, his system *bound* herbarium samples into books that could be cited. It wasn't until Linnaeus that the plants were freed to individual sheets.

Anyone interested in the history of botany should visit, it is a truly lovely place with a wonderful arboretum, aquatic plant collection, and a greenhouse devoted to succulents. What struck me however, as the most wonderful of this garden was the fact that it consists of several smaller gardens, each with their own history, often founded in different centuries. There is a large section called the scuola botanica where plants are arranged by family, another older garden where plants are arranged by their medicinal uses, yet another garden devoted to cedars(?). Of course, these are all very common ways of organizing gardens, but seeing all these different paradigms in such small gardens reminded me again of all the different ways we categorize plants and the ways that we have prioritized different organizational patterns over time. In this garden, Andrea Cesalpino, Ghini's successor, worked on his book *De Plantis Libris XVI* (1583). This book described over 1,500 plants not as an herbal or alphabetically, but by a hybrid of a modifided Aristotelian woody-non-woody classification, and his original classification of plants by their flowers and seeds.

And of course, this got me thinking about Linnaeus and his garden (Linnéträdgården) and how language plays such a fundamental role in our endeavors as botanists in ways pretty unique to our field. I argue that botanists think about their language far more and more thoughtfully than any other practioners of science and are thus well-equipped to help scientists generally deal with existential problems when it comes to communication and the future of our professions. But more on that at the end of the talk, first I wish to speak a little about the interactions between ideology, aestetics, and language to explore how we exist within a multiplicity of "ways of seeing," and how that is a good thing, and how *that* should be the method of attack when approaching the task of science communication. 

# Background
First some background! What am I even talking about when I say language? And how does that interact with ideology and aestetics and isn't that something we don't have to worry about as scientists?

So who even thinks about language as a scientist? Well, I know Brent Mishler does and his papers on the species problem and the taxon problem (1) are fantastic exmaples of really fruitful debate that inform and drive forward research in the field of systematics. And this year, of course, is the XIX International Botanical Congress in Shenzhen, China. It is here that an international body votes to adopt changes to the [*International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants*](http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title). If you haven't read the code, I would recommend it. You know, I used to suffer from insomnia before becoming a botanist. It is a laborous process, first prososed changes to the code must be published in *Taxon*, the journal of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) and then voting happens over the course of a week during the Congress every six years. Anyways, it is a highly codified system that we use to name plants and it is within this highly structural approach that we conduct science. Now, I want to convince you that this framework has implications for all of us, not just the pedants.
