# Fall 2024 Tenure Portfolio Year 3 Skyline College
Hello! Welcome Tenure Committee! Thank you for being a part of my committee and giving me the opportunity to share my portfolio for you all. On this page you will find the links to all of the required material for my tenure portfolio as well as a rationale for why these are good and representative examples of my work.

This is my third year teaching at Skyline and this portfolio is a reflection of the work that I have done so far during my time here.

I bring nine years of teaching experience in higher education to my role as Assistant Professor and am committed to bringing student-centered and equitable practices to my courses.

You can learn more about my teaching philosophy below and I hope you enjoy the subsequent linked materials.

## Teaching Philosophy
[Here](https://michaelsongagradstudent.github.io/blog/2022/10/12/Teaching-Philosophy) is a statement of my teaching philosophy.

## Examples of Work
My course **syllabus** for [BIOL 215](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ygOtrPWUWbjW4ADPwr--O9_1qZBOG4yl/view?usp=share_link).

An example [**quiz**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ZmRxWAb_cKlTx-JnSZnlXm9Va3vEMhlCBK12pAomiY/edit) and an example [**exam**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lC5AeCmI0t33ETkdXTxg9vuZ2owGJzqewRwQGsHMZKM/edit?usp=sharing) for BIOL 215, a course for majors.

Here is an [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ywlnEgnYV2Vggj7n-1m5OEO_ZWs6wu-vrDRBSv6F2iU/edit) of a **key information handout** for the plant unit of 215.

Here is an [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QoWNUp9wRhnoJojbyO5xOWYRZJmgGQ4j_pJcl1heT4A/edit?usp=share_link) of a **key project** using iNaturalist to teach taxonomy.

Here is an [example](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QLZlE3EsxK2jbkM2j-vxt9KMZcyQVTzO/view?usp=share_link) of a **worksheet** on evolution.
Examples of some [**discussion prompts**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13_huUnvvpwsLPTrLrJftVhgqu3tMY7coWDtT8DXxWws/edit).

Here is an [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10UEZ4T8RxxcloNn33e4X_crX-FDMIaiPlDxDUL5IB7U/edit#heading=h.si8b46euu0k7) of a **representative assignment** teaching students how to use primary sources.

Finally, I re-wrote the [lab manual for Biol 215](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17NYHa7MvVQS5i2gXrjhKe61Pgp_4NW0e/view?usp=sharing) as a ZTC OER!

## Rationale for inclusion in the portfolio

The work above is representative of my teaching philosophy.

My examples demonstrate how I have moved away from assessing rote memorization towards encouraging a synthesis of the material by having short answer questions in my quizzes and midterms.

I stress discussion, synthesis, and clear articulation of ideas via group work and writing instead of test taking skills and memorization. This practice promotes equity in the classroom since it does not reward more priviledged students.

The pr√©cis assignment and iNaturalist project assignment demonstrate my commitment to encouraging student creativity and curiousity in a structured and rigorous way that is at the same time student-led.

I also am committed to the Skyline College Education Master Plan (especially number 3: "Ensure that all students have the support and resources needed to achieve their educational goals") and have thus made all of my courses ZTC with OERs, including the lab manual that I have written.  

## Professional Development activities:

This summer I attended the 3-day [SEPAL](https://www.sfsusepal.org/courses/) Scientific Teaching Institute Professional Development workshop: Strengthening Student Motivation and Resilience through Research.  

I also attended the [National Conference on Race and Ethnicity in Higher Education](https://ncore.ou.edu) as well as the [Evolution 2023 Conference](https://www.evolutionmeetings.org) as a presenter. 

Here is a [draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DodukYvfaKcHjUbPJZeKjHNv1q7WUVvFWmyNG3X7PmY/edit#heading=h.aixftmplc9i) of an NSF BRC BIO Grant Proposal that I will be reapplying for in Spring 2024.

A [pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.17.541228v1) of a peer reviewed manuscript recently accepted pending minor revisions in Evolution Letters, Impact Factor = 5.0.

I have also applied for a ZTC grant to make BIOL 101 a zero textbook cost course.

## Professional Service:

I am currently serving on Academic Senate at a voting member, the STEM Division Scholarship Committee, and on an adjunct professor Evaluation Committee. 7 Points. 

I also led an [Expanding Your Horizons](https://skylinecollege.edu/eyh/) Workshop, led an activity during [Skyline Earth Fest](https://skylineshines.skylinecollege.edu/uncategorized/skyline-college-celebrates-earth-day-with-interactive-fun-and-educational-exhibits/), was a speaker at the [uSOAR conference](https://skylinecollege.edu/usoar/panelists.php), mentored an intern from the [Energize Colleges Program](https://sites.google.com/my.smccd.edu/smcccdsustainability/get-involved/internships-more/energize-colleges) at Skyline College, mentored a student as a part of [IMMERSE in STEM](https://www.skylinecollege.edu/immerse/#:~:text=IMMERSE%20in%20STEM%20scholars%20will,address%20financial%20and%20academic%20barriers.) at Skyline, and am a participant in the [Online SLOAC Academy](https://skylinecollege.edu/sloac/).
