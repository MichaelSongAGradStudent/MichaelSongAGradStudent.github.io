## Statement of Teaching Philosophy
Michael Song

My student-focused teaching philosophy is informed by what I have learned by the diametrically opposed pedagogies of the two institutions that have shaped my academic career: the small elite private liberal arts Reed College and the large public R1 University of California Berkeley. 

At Reed College I learned that a “student-focused” school can be student-focused for some students but leave others behind—often those that come from disadvantaged backgrounds. When I attended Reed, there were still memories of commencements where the speaker would say, “Look around to your left and to your right, only one of you will graduate,” and while Reed is the third in the nation in producing PhDs per graduate, it had until recently broadly ignored the students who dropped out or surprisingly did not want to become graduate students. However, the attention given to students by professors and the treatment of students by professors as colleagues gives an elect group of students the opportunity to develop as extremely strong thinkers, possibly the best the American system of higher education has to offer. 

At Berkeley, no one expects that students here want to become academics. The highly competitive, job-focused and atomized undergraduate experience here historically has been a positive societal engine of bringing working class and first generation students into the middle class. However, with a worsening economic landscape, growing average student loan debt, and the increasing of university austerity measures, it is unclear that this non-student centered model of education meets either the demands of the market or the satisfaction of the students. Students here are not encouraged to develop as thinkers but rather to work towards the credentials of a global brand. Nonetheless, the very proximity to world-class research and the high quality of instructors and professors allows the extremely motivated students to succeed. 

Both of these schools have something to offer to the self-motivated and unburdened student, but one who would thrive no matter where they went. What both schools lack in different ways is an emphasis on a student-focused AND equitable learning environment. My teaching philosophy is that students should be encouraged to participate in the process of learning in order to meet their own goals but in a structured environment. To this end, I believe that students should know what the learning objectives of the course are and to be given many small assessments and opportunities for feedback to the instructor to make sure that everyone is on the same page and understanding the material, not to have extremely high stakes “assessments” and “weed-out” classes. Students should be developing knowledge and skills that both prepare them for further advanced study but that also have transferable application to both trade and industry. This is obviously one of the strong aspects of a STEM education but one that is not common to see in classrooms. More often than not it is either “learn these skills to make money” or “we are going to develop your ideas not skills.” When we develop both skills but also the ability to think critically we are giving the opportunity for students to explore what they want from an education and from life.
