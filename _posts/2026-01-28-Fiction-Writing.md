## Published Works of Fiction and Popular Writing
- My story ["The Asterisk"](https://everydayfiction.com/the-asterisk-by-mick-song/), orginally titled "The Sphincter" was published by Every Day Fiction, a hold over website from when you could actually find content on the internet that wasn't AI slop. RIP the RSS feed!
