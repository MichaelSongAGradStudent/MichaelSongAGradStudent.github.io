## Published Works of Fiction and Popular Writing
- My story ["The Asterisk"](https://everydayfiction.com/the-asterisk-by-mick-song/), orginally titled "The Sphincter" was published by Every Day Fiction, a hold over website from when you could actually find content on the internet that wasn't AI slop. RIP the RSS feed!
- My first work of puzzle writing titled ["Cryptogam(e)s: Fern Word Puzzles"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CYG3ZxkE4QEDIbHc4Il6TSmOKroV9wlx/view?usp=sharing) was published in the [Fiddlehead Forum](https://www.amerfernsoc.org/fiddlehead-forum) Vol. 51 Issue 2 Pages 22-25. I wrote some riddles and cryptic crossword clues and talk about T.S. Eliot.
