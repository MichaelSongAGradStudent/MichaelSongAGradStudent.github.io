# Fall 2023 Tenure Portfolio Year 2 Skyline College
Hello! Welcome Tenure Committee! Thank you for being a part of my committee and giving me the opportunity to share my portfolio for you all. On this page you will find the links to all of the required material for my tenure portfolio as well as a rationale for why these are good and representative examples of my work.

This is my second year teaching at Skyline and this portfolio is a reflection of the work that I have done so far during my time here.

I bring eight years of teaching experience in higher education to my new role as Assistant Professor and am committed to bringing student-centered and equitable practices to my courses.

You can learn more about my teaching philosophy below and I hope you enjoy the subsequent linked materials.

## Teaching Philosophy
[Here](https://michaelsongagradstudent.github.io/blog/2022/10/12/Teaching-Philosophy) is a statement of my teaching philosophy.

## Examples of Work
My course syllabi for [BIOL 101]() and [BIOL 215]().

An example [quiz]() and an example [exam]() for BIOL 215, a course for majors.

Some example [discussion prompts]() and an example [exam]() for BIOL 101, a course for non-majors.

Here is an [example]() of a key information handout.

Here is an [example]() of a key project.

Here is an [example]() of a representative assignment.

## Rationale for inclusion in the portfolio

The work above is representative of my teaching philosophy.

In my non-majors class, I use discussion questions on canvas and in person group discussion as a way to increase engagement and to assess student learning in alternative ways to only high stakes midterms.

In my majors course, my examples demonstrate how I have moved away from assessing rote memorization towards encouraging a synthesis of the material by having short answer questions in my quizzes and midterms.

In both classes, I stress discussion, synthesis, and clear articulation of ideas via group work and writing instead of test taking skills and memorization. This practice promotes equity in the classroom since it does not reward more priviledged students.

Finally, the pr√©cis assignment and iNaturalist project assignment demonstrate my commitment to encouraging student creativity and curiousity in a structured and rigorous way that is at the same time student-led.

## Professional Development activities:

This summer I attended the 3-day [SEPAL](https://www.sfsusepal.org/courses/) Scientific Teaching Institute workshop.  

Here is a [draft]() of an NSF BRC BIO Grant Proposal that I will be reapplying for in Spring 2024.

A [pre-print]() of a peer reviewed manuscript recently accepted pending minor revisions in Evolution Letters.

I have also applied for a ZTC grant to make BIOL 101 a zero textbook cost course.

## Professional Service:

I am currently serving on Academic Sentate at a voting member, the STEM Division Scholarship Committee, and on an adjunct professor Evaluation Committee.
