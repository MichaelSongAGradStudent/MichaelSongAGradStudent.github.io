## Upcoming Courses I teach
### UC Berkeley IB 290 -- Plant Survey
Description: This will be a clade-based seminar course: each participant will be responsible (individually, or in small groups, depending on the number of students enrolled) for preparing a selection of herbarium or live specimens and an introductory presentation of the morphology, natural history, taxonomy, and systematics of a clade of their interestâ€”a hands-on, show-and-tell style class discussion (possibly with keying activities, and culinary or ethnobotanical experiences). The instructors will work with the herbarium and UCMP to allow students access to most of the museum material and will then take a backseat to their expertise, though they will lead a couple discussions themselves. The level of the material covered will thus be largely driven by the students taking the course, but we anticipate focusing mostly on mosses, ferns, and lichens. For the purposes of the class, plants will be loosely defined as those organisms treated by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants so lichenologists, mycologists, phycologists, and Friends of the Jepson Herbarium are welcome, as well as any student generally interested in plants.

## Guest Lectures
