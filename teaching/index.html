UC Berkeley, Undergraduate honors thesis, Jonathan Qu, "Resolving reticulate evolution of Polysticum in California"
</p>

Allopolyploidy is a form of speciation consisting of hybridization followed by genome duplication, and is understudied in the field despite being common in plants.
Polystichum californicum is known to be an allopolyploid fern, but its evolutionary history is unclear and the identity of its progenitors is uncertain.
Our project involves sampling Polystichum californicum and its potential progenitors in their ranges in California and beyond, in order to shed light on the process of allopolyploidy as it occurs in nature, as well as to resolve the taxonomic confusion surrounding these morphologically similar species of Polystichum.   


<h2>IB 102 LF California Plants</h2>
Art and creativity is critical to learning and is a central part of my pedagogy. Here are some of my students' incredible work from Spring 2016.

<h2>IB 290 -- Plant Survey</h2>
I designed and will help teach a graduate seminar in the Spring of 2019.
<p>
Description: This will be a clade-based seminar course: each participant will be responsible (individually, or in small groups, depending on the number of students enrolled) for preparing a selection of herbarium or live specimens and an introductory presentation of the morphology, natural history, taxonomy, and systematics of a clade of their interestâ€”a hands-on, show-and-tell style class discussion (possibly with keying activities, and culinary or ethnobotanical experiences). The instructors will work with the herbarium and UCMP to allow students access to most of the museum material and will then take a backseat to their expertise, though they will lead a couple discussions themselves. The level of the material covered will thus be largely driven by the students taking the course, but we anticipate focusing mostly on mosses, ferns, and lichens. For the purposes of the class, plants will be loosely defined as those organisms treated by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants so lichenologists, mycologists, phycologists, and Friends of the Jepson Herbarium are welcome, as well as any student generally interested in plants.

<h2>Reed College Guest Lectures</h2>
I occationally guest lecture at Reed College (Biology 352 - Bioinformatics and Biology 363 - Genes, Genetics, and Genomes). Will post lecture slides and handouts soon!
