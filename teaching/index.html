<h1>Fall 2022 Dr. Song Tenure Portfolio</h1>
	
	<h3>Background</h3>
	<p>Hello! Welcome Tenure Committee! Thank you for being a part of my committee and giving me the opportunity to share my portfolio for you all. On this page you will find the links to all of the required material for my tenure portfolio as well as a rationale for why these are good and representative examples of my work.</p>
	<p>This is my first year teaching at Skyline and this portfolio is a reflection of the work that I have done so far in Fall 2022.</p>
	<p>I bring six years of teaching experience in higher education to my new role as Assistant Professor and am committed to bringing student-centered and equitable practices to my courses.</p>
	<p>You can learn more about my teaching philosophy below and I hope you enjoy the subsequent linked materials.</p>

	<h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
	<p><a href="https://michaelsongagradstudent.github.io/blog/2022/10/12/Teaching-Philosophy">Here</a> is a statement of my teaching philosophy.</p>

	<h3> Rationale for inclusion in the portfolio</h3>
	<p>The work above is representative of my teaching philosophy.</p>
	<p>In my non-majors class, I use discussion questions on canvas and in person group discussion as a way to increase engagement and to assess student learning in alternative ways to only high stakes midterms. </p>
	<p>In my majors course, my examples demonstrate how I have moved away from assessing rote memorization towards encouraging a synthesis of the material by having short answer questions in my quizzes and midterms.</p>
	<p>In both classes, I stress discussion, synthesis, and clear articulation of ideas via group work and writing instead of test taking skills and memorization. This practice promotes equity in the classroom since it does not reward more priviledged students.</p>
	<p>Finally, the pr√©cis assignment and final project assignment demonstrate my commitment to encouraging student creativity and curiousity in a structured and rigorous way that is at the same time student-led.</p>
	
	<h3>Professional Development activities:</h3>
	<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DodukYvfaKcHjUbPJZeKjHNv1q7WUVvFWmyNG3X7PmY/edit">Here</a> is a draft of an NSF BRC BIO Grant Proposal.</p>
	<p>A publication in the American Fern Journal with an undergraduate student co-author see <a href="https://michaelsongagradstudent.github.io/cv/">CV.</a></p>
	<p>I have also applied for a ZTC grant to make BIOL 101 a zero textbook cost course.
	
	<h3>Professional Service:</h3>
	<p>I am currently serving on the Division Scholarship Committee and on an adjunct professor Evaluation Committee.</p>
