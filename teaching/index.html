<h1>Fall 2022 Dr. Song Tenure Portfolio</h1>
	
	<h3>Background</h3>
	<p>Hello! Welcome Tenure Committee! Thank you for being a part of my committee and giving me the opportunity to share my portfolio for you all to review and provide me with your expert feedback. On this page you will find the links to all of the required material for my tenure portfolio as well as a rationale for why these are good and representative examples of my work.</p>
	<p>This is my first year teaching at Skyline and this portfolio is a reflection of the work that I have done so far in Fall 2022.</p>
	<p>I bring six years of teaching experience in higher education to my new role as Assistant Professor and am committed to bringing student-centered and equitable practices to my courses.</p>
	<p>You can learn more about my teaching philosophy below and I hope you enjoy the subsequent linked materials.</p>
